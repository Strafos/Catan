# Settlers of Catan notes

I played a ton catan in the weeks before Fall 2019. Here's an aggregate of everything I learned.

## Pick order
One house rule I play with is the person who rolls the highest in the beginning gets to decide pick order. This leads to a bit more skill expression in draft.

1. If there are two spots that are about equal, pick second
1. First pick pick strat: take the 6-9-5 hex and most of the time, there will be a 8-5-port, 8-5-4 or 8-10-port hex open for second pick. The port doesn't have to be for a high quantity resource. Then build towards an 11 or 3. This gives you insane number coverage
11. The strength of ports in this case is as insurance. It's not uncommon to have 9 wheat dots and 4 sheep dots but have extra sheep that's useless. A sheep port can be valuable in this situation. Thus, a port for a resource that you don't have a ton of can still be good.
1. Early picks should place their roads away from the center. Avoid building towards a high value hex because it will probably be taken.
1. Last pick has a high skill floor and lowest skill ceiling. Early pick is the opposite. Stronger players are much better at taking advantage of early draft picks because it requires planning around opponents.
1. Last pick (esp in 4 person games) is sometimes forced to go for two toned hex + port. I don't think this is super strong, but often necessary because it's difficult to have all 5 resources.
1. Blocking should never influence first pick settlement. I picked first on a two stone hex thinking I would block all the stone in the game. It didn't work because other people still built next to me. This was a blunder because there was a equal dot, more diverse tile that I could have taken.
1. There seems to be light consensus online that first pick is strongest. I've been preferring second or third pick.

## Drafting

1. Maximize dots
1. Try to cover all 5 resources.
1. Four resource (4R) start:
11. Generally, there are two types of 4R games
111. In games with no starting brick or wood, you only need about 5 of the missing resource. Plan around efficient (low road #) settlements and win with 4 cities + largest army. (Note: Wood and brick are similar because they are used in equal quanitity. The only difference is there are four wood tiles and three brick tiles)
111. In games with no sheep/stone/hay, the 3rd settlement must complete your resources (esp if no port)
1. Generally, it's good to have different numbers to reduce variance. The exception to this rule is that it's good to have same numbers if the resources are synergistic. (Ex: Standard example is same number wood and brick is good because they are always used together. Same number rock and hay is similar but it's not that useful early on because cities require a lot of hits. Less common example is having a hay port + 3 hay + 1 sheep on the same number equating to a dev card)

## Longest Road

Longest road should never be a part of the plan at drafting stage because it's situational. Early game roads should be built with the intention of building settlements in good hexes. Longest road is an afterthought when key settlements are built and there's an excess of road material. I've noticed a couple patterns for longest road:

1. Early on, it's a trap. The two points put a target on your back. It's deceiving because a person with longest road has a much lower VP/resource ratio and is not actually in the lead. I usually only get with road builder or to win
1. One person clearly from the start has the most wood/brick and no one contests for longest road. In some cases, this person puts off longest road and ends up losing because someone grabs it 
1. Two people fight for longest road early on and both get behind from wasting using up resources. 
1. No one tries for longest road, the person who has a lead early is able to build it and wins because it costs so little to attain.

## Development Cards

1. Apparently an early dev card can be good and the threat of knighting is strong. I'm not entirely convinced because the Knight can be undone by a 7, monopoly should be saved, VP is disasterous, road builder is decent and year of plenty is 3 resources for 2 of any. I think that in a lot of cases (esp if you have city resources), it's better to hold and build a city. The general rule here is to increase resource production early on and dev cards do not contribute to that.
1. A good mental model for dev cards is to think of how many points each card nets.
11. Each knight is worth 2/3 VP, -2 net resource, blocks a square
11. Monopoly should convert into 2 VP. Should be saved until you can win/have winning chances.
111. The scummiest move in Catan: trade away all of your one resource and monopoly it back.
11. Year of plenty should convert to 1 VP (this means it should be used to complete a city or settlement). The real power of this card is that it essentially increases your hand size by two.
11. Road builder should convert to 1-2 VP. Getting longest road is 2 VP case. Otherwise, 2 road + settlement is common use. Only use when you fully utilize both roads, otherwise, hold on to it.

## General

1. Catan is like a greedy solution to [the knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). Consider if there is no handsize limit - the optimal strategy is to hold onto all your cards until you can build using the constituent resources and avoid trading 4 for 1s. I suspect that people are too afraid of holding 7+ cards. For example, you have 3 dots on sheep, but due to rolls and starting resource, you end up with 4 sheep. You convert 4 sheep for a brick and end up needing sheep later. I haven't done the math, but I think at least in some cases, it's better to hold and wait for more resources to build more efficiently.
1. The meta game in Catan is to convince the other players that you aren't winning.
11. In a four person game, a 7 will be rolled 50% of the time before your next turn. In a three person game, 40%. Say you have 8 cards, there _must_ be situations where it's better to have 50% chance at -4 cards than do a 4 for 1. Figuring out when to hold is the main way I'm trying to improve.
1. In my playstyle, I really hate brick and often start with no brick tiles. From draft, I have an idea of how much brick I need (usually 5-6) and play around that.
1. Cities beget more cities. I almost always put my first city on a rock hex because it accelerates city development.
